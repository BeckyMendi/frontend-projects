# MKS Front-End Cohort 1 Final Projects

## To Install

`git clone` this repo to your projects directory.

`cd` into the directory.

Check to see if you have Node installed: `node --version`

If you do not: `brew install node`

Now install Zurb Foundation using Bower: `bower install foundation`

Bower is a package manager, so it will keep Foundation up to date for you!

Run the following command to make Sass watch for changes to your stylesheet: `sass --watch scss/app.scss:stylesheets/app.css`

This says, "Sass, watch the file `scss/app.scss` to see if there are any changes to it. If there are, compile it to regular css at the file `stylesheets/app.css`. Yay!"
